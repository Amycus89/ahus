The purpose of this project is primarily meant to serve as an exercise in CSS, but also to showcase some memories of my childhood, as I grew up in the swedish town of Åhus (Mind the "Å").

I will be using my own illustrations and photos, unless otherwise specified.

Update 1: Apperently I had a lot fewer photos from my childhood that could be used for this project than I thought, so I had to supplement with stock images. I let the watermarks remain to show their sources. Unfortunately I was unable to find a stock photo of the "kungsstugan" that I could use, so for now I put an image of a moose as a placeholder (generated by Bing image creator).

Also credit to Greatstack, for their youtube tutorial which I used for the "places" section as an exercise (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly4Dqz2Mz8s&list=LL&index=6&t=33s). I used it as a learning experience, and plan to modify it later for my own purposes. I learned a lot from it.
